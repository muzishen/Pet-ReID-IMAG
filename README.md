# Pet-ReID-IMAG
 The 3rd place solution to CVPR2022 Biometrics Workshop Pet Biometric Challenge
---- 
## Introduction
- :blush: We only trained one model (ResNeSt) with different scales (i.e., 224, 256, and 288), respectivel achieved 91.7% and 86.27% in phase A and B.
- :rocket: Traing time cost ~1.5 hour with a V100 16GB, so easy, no bells and whistles! 
- :eyes: Techical details are described in our [arXiv preprint paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15934.pdf). 
- :point_right: The train/test data can be obtained from [百度云](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17tnCE8b-oSh8xGMHczPzqQ?pwd=imag), [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_7pdSRTvD_XdTu8z0MxrM9PDoEuX-tjf?usp=drive_link).
- :point_right: The weights can be obtained from [百度云](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17tnCE8b-oSh8xGMHczPzqQ?pwd=imag), [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_7pdSRTvD_XdTu8z0MxrM9PDoEuX-tjf?usp=drive_link).
- Click on the star  :star:, Thank you :heart:
